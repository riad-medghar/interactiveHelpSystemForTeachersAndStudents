1.Use a database for user authentication: Currently, the code only checks
  if the username and password match the predefined static variables.
  In a real-world application, you would want to store user credentials
  in a database and authenticate users against that database. You can
  use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect your application
  to a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL javaguides.net, javaguides.net.

2.Implement a password hashing mechanism: Storing passwords as plain text
  is a security risk. Instead, you should store a hashed version of the
  password and compare the hashed version of the entered password with the
  stored hash. You can use libraries like BCrypt or Argon2 to hash
  passwords.

3.Use a design pattern for the GUI: The current implementation of the GUI
  is not scalable and can become difficult to manage as the application
  grows. Consider using a design pattern like MVC (Model-View-Controller)
  or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to separate the concerns of your
  application.

4.Add validation to the input fields: Currently, the code does not validate
  the input fields. You should add validation to check if the fields are
  not empty and if they meet certain criteria (e.g., the email field should
  contain a valid email address).

5.Use a more flexible layout manager: The current code uses a null layout,
  which is not recommended because it doesn't adjust well to different 
  screen sizes and resolutions. Consider using a more flexible layout 
  manager like BorderLayout, GridLayout, or GroupLayout.
//still not applied.
6.Handle exceptions properly: The code should handle exceptions properly. 
  For instance, when writing to the file, it should handle the IOException 
  that might be thrown.
